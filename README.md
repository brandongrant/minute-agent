Hi, How Are You?

It's a keycounter that you install on your OSX
computer. It fills in a log at ~/log/keystrokes.log with
the number of keystrokes you make every minute.

All it does is count keystrokes. Unlike a keylogger,
it doesn't steal your money, or do anything amusing that gains
national attention. If you don't trust me,
read the horribly constructed Objective-C yourself, or
don't use it.

It requires the Accessibility API to enabled,
or for you to trust the application.
